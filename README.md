# Welcome to Wini'sSchoolOfCoding

At **Wini'sSchoolOfCoding**, we believe that everyone should have the opportunity to learn how to code, regardless of the language they speak. Our mission is simple: to break down language barriers in tech education and make learning to code accessible to all.

At Wini'sSchoolOfCoding, we offer courses in various programming languages—**taught in your native language**. Whether you're learning in **English**, **Swahili**, **Sign Language**, **Latin**, **Luo**, **Sheng** (slang) -- you name it, we ensure that the content is delivered in a way that makes sense to you. We believe that coding is a universal skill, and no one should be left out because of language barriers.

Our slogan, _"Learn a Language in Your Language,"_ reflects our commitment to providing a personalized and inclusive learning experience. We help you master coding concepts without the added challenge of unfamiliar languages, so you can focus on developing your skills and building your future in tech.

In addition to our courses, we provide **documentation and learning resources** that break down complex coding concepts in simple, easy-to-understand ways — again, in the language of your choice. Our goal is to make coding approachable, no matter your background or experience level.

We’re here to inspire the next generation of coders, helping them unlock their potential and thrive in a digital world. Whether you're a beginner or looking to sharpen your skills, join us on this journey and let’s build the future of tech — together.
